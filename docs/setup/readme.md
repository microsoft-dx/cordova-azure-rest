To follow this Hands-on-Lab, you will need the following:

 1. Microsoft Azure subscription
 --------------------------------

In order to create a free Azure Subscription, you can either use:

- the free monthly Azure credit which comes with the (also free) [Visual Studio Dev Essentials](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/member-offers/vs-dev-essentials/) offer.
- a [Microsoft Azure Pass](http://www.microsoftazurepass.com/) - provided you have received a code from Microsoft representatives or partners
- a standard [Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

1a. Sign up for Visual Studio Dev Essentials
---------------------------------------------

[Visual Studio Dev Essentials](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/member-offers/vs-dev-essentials/) is a free bundle from Microsoft which offers developers the chance to experiment and learn with MS-ecosystem solutions like: Azure, Xamarin, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Team Services and so on.

By using a [Microsoft Azure Pass](http://www.microsoftazurepass.com/) code, you can create a free trial subscription without the need of a credit card.

You need the following:

Alternatively, you can get a standard trial subscription for Microsoft Azure, to use in order to test any services currently available in the Microsoft cloud. 

Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) and follow the instructions in order to obtain a free Azure trial.


2. Visual Studio 2015 with Apache Cordova Tools
------------------------------------------------

To create the .NET backend and to test the mobile application, you will need  [Visual Studio Community 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) and the [Apache Cordova Tools](https://taco.visualstudio.com/) for the mobile application.

3. Intellij Idea Community Edition
----------------------------------
For the Java backend, we will use [IntelliJ Idea from JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) that also has a Community Edition. Then, we will deploy the application in the Cloud using the [Microsoft Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8053).
